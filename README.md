There are other 3rd party pre-requisites for some of the projects I will be pushing.
For the Decision Tree Algo, you will need to pip install graphviz and pip install pydotplus in your cli/terminal
If it doesnt work try sudo apt install graphviz pydotplus (in debian based linux distros)
Or sudo pacman -S graphviz pydotplus (in arch based linux distros)
